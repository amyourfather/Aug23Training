A. Organize the project
1. All items specific to the website under test should be in same folder
2. TestClasses should be in /tests folder
3. Page Objects should be in /pageObjects folder
4. SuperClasses should be in /foundation folder
5. Ensure that all package references are updated
5. Create a /framework folder that contains the WebDriver Factory classes and other general Super Classes

B. Make your automation project portable
1. Create a 'resources' folder under root of the project
2. Create a config.properties text file in the resources folder
3. All webDrivers will be located in this folder instead of local drives
4. Read the browser type from config.properties

C. Make your automation project cross-browser compatible
1. Your project should be compatible with Chrome and Edge browsers
2. You should be able to switch browsers by changing the BrowserType parameter in config.properties
3. TestBase should be the only class which calls WebDriverManager.createDriver(); 
4. Implement the WebDriver factory pattern from the Design Patterns slide deck. Ensure that the WebDriverManagers for each browser launch the Web Drivers from /resources
